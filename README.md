# naver_real_estate

This is for pulling information from Naver Real Estate websites.
The information on the website is easy to use as it allows a map-based user interface.

However, when you need to check lots of data from multiple housing complexes, easpecially when you want to find a sudden, quickly-disappearing property--that is usually the cheapest one, the website does not offer much of the conveniences to users.

Therefore, I have come up with this solution.

This is still a work in progress.
